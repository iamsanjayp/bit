            "example 1":"Question-Hey lina!, I just bought a laptop. I barely used it last night before closing the lid and going to sleep. Today morning When tried to turn it on, only the power light flashes but no display. I did try power draining the laptop and reconnecting the charger and turning it on. Yet I face the same issue. Answer-It seems like your laptop is not booting into an operating system, This is probably because the original os should have been corrupted.\n You may need to visit a lenovo authorized service center to install a new os.\n For future references create snapshots of your system so you can always restore your system to stock.\n Also make sure to power off your system properly or put it to sleep properly.\n",
            "example 2":"Question-Hey lina!, My computer is running very slowly all of a sudden. what should i do? Answer-Hey, It seems like your computer's cpu and ram are being overloaded with processes or it must be that your storage drive is slow due to exessive file.\n I would recommend cleaning up your drive and uninstalling apps and processes that you no longer use.\n Try using disk cleanup to delete temproary and unimportent files.\n Disk clean up is a default app included with windows.\n But another reason for a sluggish system maybe because there is a virus or a trojhan horse.\n Try running a security scan using your prefered antivirus software and if an issue is found follow the recommended actions by your antivirus software.\n",
